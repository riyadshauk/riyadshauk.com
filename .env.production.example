# Production-specific notes:
# - Use strong, unique passwords for production
# - Consider using a managed database service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.)
# - Ensure your database host is accessible from your deployment environment
# - Use SSL connections in production (most managed services enable this by default)
# - DB_PASSWORD is optional but highly recommended for production security
